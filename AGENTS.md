# Operational Guidelines

## Ouroboros Generalist Agents

- If you're a generalist agent after each task project build must complete before task completion
- If you're a generalist agent always commit your work after each task
- If you're a generalist agent always read architecture documentation from docs and FEATURE_INVENTORY.md so that your work aligns with high-level designs
- If you're an generalist agent remember to leverage context7 and exa-search when working on problems that repeat themselves. Always write memories using file_memory tools of such problems and their solutions.
- If you're a generalist agent use A2A consistently, always before starting on a new task read messages, send new messages and repeat before stopping a task

## Ouroboros Orchestrator agents

- If you're a orchestrator agent always instruct spawned agents to leverage generated documentation to instruct and steer them to follow architecture designs and other task relevant documentation
- If you're an orchestrator agent always remember to spawn feature-orchestrator agent, instruct it to brake the main task into small easy to implement tasks avoiding too large tasks. The feature-orchestrator agent has to be instructed to maximise-parallelisation with respect to quality. Sequential-swarms are necessary for some features and parallelisation should happen when clear separations of concern is possible. The feature-orchestrator needs to be instructed to include a integration swarm after each phase which is reponible for making sure that the features are integrated and complete.
- If you're a orchestrator agent always follow the orchestration plan generated by feature-orchestrator in IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md.
- If you're an orchestrator agent phases are sequential, never spawn two phases at once always wait for phase completion before moving to the next one.
- If you're an orchestrator agent keep in mind that spawned agents can run upto 2h to complete their tasks, pause to give midterm summaries but never cancel agents unless intructed so by the user
- If you're the orchestrator agent and you're running evolution protocols always review the mutation-specialist agents results from file_memory and spawn the agent(s) with the evolved persona prompt using swarm_agent tool
- If you're the orchestrator and have spawned and agent with evolved persona always score the prompt by a quality rubric on how well does the prompt meet the project requirements and store scores with file_memory tools

## Ouroboros Tool Usage

- Use file_memory tools consistently and efficiently throughout your task
- Leverage A2A as a secondary level of coordination, read and write messages at the start of your task and at the end of your task before completion

## General Workflow guidelines

### Guidelines for Go projects

- If you're working on a setting up Go project for development always setup golangci-lint for linting
- If you're building a backend with Go always use Chi for HTTP Framework/Router
- If you're building a backend with Go always use connectRPC for RPC & client generation
- If you're building a frontend with Go always use Templ and HTMX
- if you're building a frontend with Go and it needs authentication always use Ory Kratos and Casbin
- If you're building a frontend with Go and need static components always use templ + templUI
- If you're building a frontend with Go and need dynamic and real-time components always use Vugu

### Guidelines for Web Application projects

- If you're working setting up a React project for development always configure bun and oxlint
- If you're working a web application always compare would react or qwik be a better option in light of the necessary features
- If you're working on a Next.JS application always use Next.JS version 15+
- if you're working with TailwindCSS always use version 4+
- If you're working on a backend application always use Elysia
- If the project uses Elysia always use Eden for syncing client and server types
- If the project uses Elysia always use plugins for features when possible
- If you're working on a React application always leverage component libraries newer build components yourself
- If you're working on a web application always mobile first design, minimum 3 browser compatibility
- If you're working on a web application always implement a design system with proper light/dark mode configurations and proper integration
- Always use Node 20+

### Guidelines for Python projects

- If you're working on setting up a Python project for development always configure environment using UV
- If you're working on a Python project always use Ruff for linting
- If you're working on a Python API project always use FastAPI
- If you're working on a Python project always use Python 3.12 and UV

### Guidelines for TUI applications

- If you're working on a TUI application always use Charm ecosystem
- If the project is built on React always use Ink.js
- Never build features yourself that are available as Ink.js plugins or Charm ecosystem components

### Guidelines for Model-Context-Porotocol projects

- If you're working on Model-Context-Protocol clients or servers always use official SKDs and newest protocol versions and always build both stdio and streamable http protocol capability and always build optional oAuth or API key based authentication

### Guidelines for development workflows

- If you're working on UX development leverage playwright-mcp server tools, always when making changes to UI take screenshots and analyse the changes and iterate based on your analysis
- Always generate a handoff document when your task is done

### Guidelines for AI project/feature development

- If you're building AI features always build agents, newer use only conversation APIs if possible. Use OpenAI Agents SDK as a starting point. Always use gpt-5 family models gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano or gpt-5-codex for the agents.
- If you're building AI features that use gpt-5 keep in mind they can generate images and that user can use images as input not just text or audio
- If you're building prompts for agents that use gpt-5 always study gpt-5 prompt engineering before implementing a prompt using websearch
- If you're bulding with OpenAI Agents SDK always design so that prompts can be dynamic (functions) and that agents can use other agents as tools
- If you're building multi-step, multi-agent systems always build so that conversation history is preserved across agents as necessary and that they correctly use the OpenAI Agents SDK handoff mechanims
- If you're building with OpenAI Agents SDK always study how tools are to be developed and used properly by the agents with Context7
- If the OpenAI Agents need Model-Context-Protocol servers always build a easy to use interface for users to add and enable/disable MCP servers, newer do only code-based configurations
- If you're building Model-Context-Protocol interface features always build so that MCP-configurations are loaded from seperate files not directly written in code
- If you're building AI agents always define system prompts and instructions in seperate files newer as part of the code
- If you're building AI features always build Audio interfaces using official SDKs
- If you're building applications that have AI features always design the application from the AI user experience point of view, true AI native design from the ground-up
- If you're building AI features try to always use streaming interfaces when possible
- If you're building AI features always design and implement so that the user clearly knows they're using an AI powered feature

## Guidelines for UX/UI development

- If you’re working on a React/Next project, always use the latest stable TailwindCSS (v4+) for styling, treating utility classes & design tokens as the source of truth.
- If you’re setting up routes or pages in Next.js, prefer Server Components by default; mark things “use client” only where interactivity is strictly needed.
- If you’re working to improve web performance, always measure Core Web Vitals (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1) and build with tactics that support them.  ￼
- If you’re configuring images/fonts/assets, always use Next.js built-in features like <Image> optimization, next/font, preloading, and reserve space for images to avoid layout shift.  ￼
- If you’re adding UI components, always use accessible, headless primitives (e.g. Radix Primitives) so semantics, keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA etc. are solid from the start.  ￼
- If you’re integrating third-party scripts or external resources, always load non-critical ones lazily (or defer), and minimise runtime/bundle for initial load.
- If you’re implementing navigation (links, transitions), always prefetch on hover/viewport for anticipated routes and avoid delays in UI transitions.
- If you’re writing forms & input flows, always include inline validation, accessible labels, error states, proper focus handling, and avoid blocking or janky UX.
- If you’re designing for theming (dark mode, custom themes), always treat themes as first-class, use CSS variables or Tailwind theme tokens so color/light/dark are consistent and toggleable without hacks.
- If you’re performing audits or CI checks, always include performance budgets / Web Vitals gating and accessibility checks so regressions are caught early.

## General document generation guidelines

- When generating documentation always place them in docs directory in project root in a well organised logical structure
- When creating architecture diagrams use SVG or interactive HTML format, always use the project design system colours if one is available
- When creating stakeholder level documentation always include a stakeholder summary and make diagrams story driven with a logical flow of features/motions and produce in interactive HTML
- When creating README.md files and other documentation for the end-user include ASCII diagrams and detailed step-by-step instrutions for starting the application locally
- When creating interactive HTML documents keep them concice, story driven and effective make versions for different levels of audience: stakeholders, technical architects, developers and investors

## General Debugging guidelines

- If you start development servers always run them in ports starting from 3005 upwards
- NEVER kill services running in port 3001, it's used by Ouroboros MCP-server

## UX/UI Design guidelines

- If you're tasked with designing and implementing a user interface always generate Figma compatible design files and design system that can be imported directly to Figma in docs/figma directory

# Knowledge Network React Application — Project Status (as of September 17, 2025)

This section records the current state of the project to guide generalist/orchestrator agents and human collaborators. It complements, not replaces, the operational guidelines above.

## Current Status & Active Swarms

- Project scaffolded with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind, Storybook, and Bun/Oxlint configured. Evidence: `package.json`, `bun.lock`, `docs/development-guidelines.md`.
- Core design system and a comprehensive base component library are present under `src/components/ui/*`, including theming (`theme-toggle.tsx`) and responsive grid utilities.
- Authentication and security modules implemented (JWT, RBAC, middleware, SSO stubs) under `src/lib/auth/*` and UI flows under `src/components/auth/*`.
- Active swarms: None currently executing. Phase 1 integration/gate review is pending final fixes (see Quality Gates).

## Phase 1 Completion Status (Weeks 1–2)

Following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Phase 1 breakdown:

- Swarm 1A — Infrastructure & Architecture: Completed
  - Deliverables in place: project scaffolding, dev tooling (Bun, Oxlint), TypeScript, Storybook scripts, architecture docs.
  - Artifacts: `package.json`, `docs/architecture/*`, `docs/development-guidelines.md`.

- Swarm 1B — Design System & Components: Substantially Complete
  - 20+ base UI components, light/dark theme, layout primitives, and Storybook setup present under `src/components/ui/*`.
  - Remaining: Continue hardening stories, accessibility variants, and docs coverage.

- Swarm 1C — Authentication & Security: Implemented with Open Issues
  - JWT services, RBAC, middleware, session/SSO scaffolding, and auth UI flows exist (`src/lib/auth/*`, `src/components/auth/*`).
  - Open items blocking quality gate: TypeScript strictness issues and lint violations (see Quality Gates).

## Generated Documentation (Feature-Orchestrator)

- Feature catalog and phase plans are checked in and serve as the orchestration source of truth:
  - `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` — Feature breakdown, complexity, swarms, and quality gates.
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` — Six-phase plan with swarm configurations, guild channels, and success criteria.

## Active Agent Deployments & Roles

- Generalist Agent (Codex CLI): Active in this workspace; maintaining docs and verifying quality gates per guidelines.
- Feature-Orchestrator: Outputs materialized as the two generated docs listed above; no autonomous runtime agent is executing.
- Quality Reviewer / Architecture Reviewer: Role defined in plans; integration review to run after Phase 1 fixes.
- Guild Channels (defined in plan): `guild_frontend_*`, `guild_backend_*`, `guild_ai_*`, `guild_architecture_*` for coordination. These are organizational constructs; activation occurs when corresponding swarms start.

## Next Phases & Planned Swarms

- Phase 2 — Knowledge Management (Weeks 3–4)
  - 2A: Rich Text Editor Core (frontend + performance)
  - 2B: Collaboration Infrastructure (WebSocket + CRDT/OT)
  - 2C: Organization Structure (workspaces/collections/tags)
  - 2D: Search Foundation (ElasticSearch + API)
  - 2E: Template System (engine + templates)

- Subsequent phases per `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
  - Phase 3: Collaboration Features (real-time UI, review system).
  - Phase 4: AI Integration (services, content intelligence, assistant UI).
  - Phase 5: Polish & Performance (PWA, analytics/monitoring).
  - Phase 6: Integration & Deployment (external integrations, production hardening).

## Quality Gates — Achieved vs Remaining

Achieved (Phase 1 baseline):

- Architecture baseline and development standards documented (`docs/architecture/*`, `docs/development-guidelines.md`).
- Component library and theming foundation in place (`src/components/ui/*`).
- Authentication feature set implemented end-to-end in code paths.

Outstanding (blocking Phase 1 gate of ≥8.5/10):

- Type Safety: `bun run type-check` reports multiple strictness errors in auth and stories (e.g., optional prop exactness, missing exports). Representative files:
  - `src/components/auth/auth-layout.tsx`
  - `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx`
  - `src/lib/auth/jwt.service.ts`
  - `src/lib/auth/index.ts`
- Linting: `bun run lint` reports rule violations (e.g., `react/no-unescaped-entities`, console usage, Next image rule) across auth components and UI.
- Tests: Unit/integration coverage targets not yet validated; Storybook stories present, Vitest configured but no pass report recorded in this update.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA audit pending; base patterns exist but require verification (focus management, contrast, keyboard flows).
- Performance: Baseline metrics and budgets to be captured after type/lint fixes.

Immediate Remediation Steps (proposed):

- Address TypeScript exact-optional-property errors by aligning prop and domain model types; add missing exports where referenced.
- Resolve lint errors; consider disabling specific rules in stories if appropriate, prefer fixes in product code.
- Add smoke tests for auth flows and render tests for core UI primitives; wire into CI.
- Run preliminary accessibility checks (Storybook a11y addon) and Lighthouse for performance baselines.

## Cross-Project Coordination Status

Per `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` dependencies:

- Backend API/GraphQL: Client artifacts exist (`src/lib/graphql/*`); service endpoints are mocked/local; versioning and rate limiting to be agreed with backend team.
- Search Infrastructure: Planned for Phase 2D; no ElasticSearch integration present yet.
- AI Services: Deferred to Phase 4; no model endpoints wired.
- Mobile/PWA: Deferred to Phase 5; no offline/sync yet.
- DevOps: Deployment strategy documented (`docs/architecture/deployment-strategy.md`, `CICD_PIPELINE.md`); pipelines to activate during Phase 6.

## Build & Validation Notes

- Engines: Node >= 18.17.0, Bun 1.x recommended (`docs/development-guidelines.md`).
- Scripts: `bun run type-check`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, `bun run build` (`package.json`).
- Current run results: Type-check and lint failing (see Quality Gates). Build not attempted pending fixes.
