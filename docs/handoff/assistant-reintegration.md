# Handoff — AI Assistant Reintegration

## Scope
- Replaced the standalone assistant page with a global OpenAI Agents powered dock available on every screen.
- Introduced a four-tool workflow (Ask, Research, Verify, Capture) surfaced through a floating launcher and keyboard shortcut (`⌘/Ctrl + I`).
- Wired workspace context (route, page title, selection text) into the assistant runtime so each invocation is aware of the current view.
- Refined transcription, research, and fact-check experiences with actionable outputs and quick prompts.
- Persisted capture results to local storage so new documents can bootstrap content from the latest meeting transcription.

## Key Assets
- `src/components/assistant/AssistantDock.tsx`
- `src/components/assistant/tools/AssistantResearchTool.tsx`
- `src/components/assistant/tools/AssistantVerifyTool.tsx`
- `src/components/assistant/tools/AssistantCaptureTool.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
- `src/app/assistant/page.tsx`
- `src/app/documents/new/page.tsx`

## Validation
```bash
bunx playwright test
```
- 16 tests, 16 passed.

## Follow-ups
1. Hook the capture auto-draft payload into the document editor to offer one-click “Populate from transcript”.
2. Extend fact-check to accept structured context (e.g., selected paragraph ID) once server APIs expose richer metadata.
3. Audit analytics/telemetry to ensure assistant interactions are captured for product insights.
