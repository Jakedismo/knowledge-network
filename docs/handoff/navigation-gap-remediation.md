# Handoff — Navigation Gap Remediation

## Scope
- Filled primary navigation gaps by implementing first-class pages for the knowledge hub, document directories, collaboration, search, profile, and document creation flows.
- Normalized CTA patterns to rely on the shared `buttonVariants` helper instead of nesting `<Button asChild>` constructs, preventing runtime hydration warnings and aligning with accessibility rules.
- Repaired the profile layout to use the project avatar compound component without missing exports, resolving the dev-server build break.
- Added Playwright navigation coverage to verify every primary route renders and to capture updated UI snapshots for design sign-off.
- Implemented a resilient template gallery fallback so the Templates page surfaces curated entries even without the Prisma-powered API.

## Validation
```bash
bunx playwright test
```
- 16 tests, 16 passed.

## Follow-ups
1. Repo currently contains unrelated doc deletions and environment files (`README.md`, `.env.docker`, etc.) made outside this task—confirm owners before committing or rebasing.
2. Type-check and lint sweeps are still outstanding repo-wide per quality gates; run `bun run type-check` and `bun run lint` once upstream issues are triaged.
3. Evaluate data integration for Phase 2: wire knowledge, collaboration, and search pages to real data sources/CRDT backends when available.
