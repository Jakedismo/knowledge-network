Guild: guild_content_intelligence_ready
Status: In-progress (foundation implemented in repo)
Date: 2025-09-18

Summary
- Swarm 4B Content Intelligence core is implemented with deterministic heuristics.
- Deliverables available:
  - Content analysis APIs: /api/content-intel/* (analyze, summarize, tags, translate)
  - Auto-tagging via TF + title boost; key concepts and entities extraction.
  - Summarization service (TextRank-like).
  - Readability + quality scoring.
  - Sentiment (lexicon-based, offline) and basic translation stub.

Coordination
- backend-typescript-architect: Review API shapes and module placement under src/server/modules/content-intel; confirm auth/guard requirements for production.
- rl-algorithm-designer: Provide guidance on weighting and evaluation metrics; propose lexicon/model upgrades and language coverage roadmap.

Next Steps
1) Decide auth guard policy (current endpoints open; align with Org permissions).
2) Optionally enrich language detection and add provider abstraction for remote ML.
3) Wire analysis into knowledge save pipeline (async enrichment) per microservices-architecture AI Service pattern.
