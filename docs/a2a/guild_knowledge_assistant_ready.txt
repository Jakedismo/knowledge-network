Swarm 4C (Knowledge Assistant UI) â€” Ready for backend integration

Deliverables (UI + mocks):
- ChatPanel, ResearchPanel, TranscriptionUploader, FactCheckBadge, ContextHelp
- Editor suggestions sidebar (selection-based)
- Provider contracts + deterministic mock provider
- Demo route: /assistant, Editor demo updated, Storybook stories
- Docs: docs/assistant/*

Integration needs from 4A/Backend:
- Chat: POST /ai/chat {input, context} -> {messages, citations}
- Suggestions: POST /ai/suggest {text, context} -> {suggestions[]}
- Fact-check: POST /ai/fact-check {claim, documentId?} -> {status, evidence[]}
- Research: POST /ai/research {query, scope} -> {items[]}
- Transcribe: POST /ai/transcribe file -> {transcript, summary, actionItems[]}

Constraints respected:
- No AI infra or recommendation systems included
- Deterministic behaviors, accessible controls, type-safe

Quality:
- Unit tests for determinism pass
- Type/lint baseline has pre-existing issues outside scope; additions are strict-safe

Next steps:
- 4A to wire providers behind factory (agents/mcp)
- Backend to expose grounding + citations
- FE to polish UX and integrate in main flows
