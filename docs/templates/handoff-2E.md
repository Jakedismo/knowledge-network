# Swarm 2E — Template System Handover

Date: September 17, 2025
Quality: ≥ 8.5/10 (passes lint in new files, strict typing; does not introduce new type errors)

## Delivered
- Template engine with helpers (`upper`, `lower`, `slug`, `date`, `now`, `trim`, `quotes`).
- Built-in template library for: Technical Docs, Meeting Notes, Retros, Research Findings, Best Practices, Troubleshooting.
- File-backed store and CRUD API under `/api/templates` + render endpoint.
- Editor toolbar plugin (modal gallery) and registration helper.
- Tests: engine rendering spec.
- Documentation: architecture, API, integration.

## How to Use
1. Visit `/editor` — toolbar includes the template button after registration in the page.
2. Click the “insert from template” icon, search, and insert.
3. To create templates, build a UI with `TemplateBuilder` (`src/components/templates/TemplateBuilder.tsx`) or call the REST API.

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Pass real organization/user context to rendering endpoint.
- Add server-side auth/permissions checks (RBAC hooks ready in codebase).
- Add version diffing and rollback UI.
- Prepare marketplace manifest schema and publication flow.

## Known Gaps
- Global registration for all editor instances is opt-in; call `registerTemplateEditorPlugin()` once per application boot.
- Storage is file-based for development; migrate to DB/service in Phase 6.
