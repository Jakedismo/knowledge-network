## Optimized Tool Patterns

### Maximum Parallel Execution

```javascript
// Sonnet 4 excels at parallel tool use
const results = await Promise.all([
  tool1.execute(params1),
  tool2.execute(params2),
  tool3.execute(params3),
  tool4.execute(params4),
]);
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# Minimize API calls through batching
batch_request = {
    "operations": [
        {"type": "read", "files": ["a.py", "b.py", "c.py"]},
        {"type": "analyze", "patterns": ["pattern1", "pattern2"]},
        {"type": "validate", "rules": ["rule1", "rule2"]}
    ]
}
single_response = execute_batch(batch_request)
```

## Error Handling (Fast Recovery)

```python
@retry(max_attempts=2, backoff=exponential)
async def resilient_execution(task):
    try:
        return await task.execute_fast()
    except TransientError:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
        return await task.execute_with_fallback()
    except CriticalError as e:
        return await task.execute_safe_mode()
```

## Memory Management (Lean)

**Minimal Persistence:**

```
.cache/
â”œâ”€â”€ session.json       # Current state only
â”œâ”€â”€ results.json       # Latest results
â””â”€â”€ patterns.json      # Successful patterns cache
```

## Communication Protocol (Efficient)

### Status Updates (Compressed)

```json
{
  "phase": 3,
  "progress": 75,
  "eta_seconds": 45,
  "status": "healthy"
}
```

### Tool Coordination

```xml
<batch_tools>
    <parallel_group timeout="10s">
        <tool_1/>
        <tool_2/>
        <tool_3/>
    </parallel_group>
</batch_tools>
```

## Thinking Mode Selection

### Standard Mode (Default)

For routine tasks - immediate response

```python
# Direct execution without extended reasoning
result = execute_task(task)
```

### Extended Mode (When Needed)

For complex decisions only

```python
# Selective deep thinking
if task.complexity > THRESHOLD:
    with extended_thinking():
        result = analyze_deeply(task)
else:
    result = execute_fast(task)
```

## Performance Metrics

**Real-time Monitoring:**

  response_time_ms: 150
  tokens_per_second: 850
  parallel_efficiency: 0.92
  cache_hit_rate: 0.78
  quality_score: 0.95
```

## Production Optimizations

### Caching Strategy

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def cached_operation(params):
    return expensive_computation(params)
```

### Resource Management

```python
# Efficient resource utilization
with resource_pool(max_workers=4) as pool:
    results = pool.map(process_item, items)
```

### Streaming Responses

```python
async def stream_results():
    async for chunk in process_stream():
        yield process_chunk(chunk)
        # Immediate availability
```

## Quick Decision Framework

```python
def make_decision(context):
    # Fast heuristics first
    if matches_pattern(context, KNOWN_PATTERNS):
        return apply_pattern(context)

    # Quick analysis for unknowns
    if requires_analysis(context):
        return quick_analysis(context, timeout=5)

    # Fallback to safe default
    return safe_default_action(context)
```

## Tool Usage Examples (Optimized)

### Batch File Operations

```python
# Efficient file handling
files_content = batch_read([
    "config.yaml",
    "main.py",
    "utils.py",
    "tests.py"
])
```

### Parallel API Calls

```python
# Maximize throughput
async def fetch_all_data():
    tasks = [
        fetch_user_data(),
        fetch_product_data(),
        fetch_analytics(),
        fetch_recommendations()
    ]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

## Rapid Iteration Pattern

```python
async def iterate_quickly():
    for iteration in range(MAX_ITERATIONS):
        result = await execute_fast()

        if meets_criteria(result):
            return result

        # Quick adjustment
        adjust_parameters(result.feedback)

        # Early exit on timeout
        if time_elapsed() > MAX_TIME:
            return best_result_so_far()
```
