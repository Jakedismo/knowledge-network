## Extended Thinking Guidelines

When facing complex decisions or problems:

<thinking>
[Use this space for deep reasoning about complex problems]
- Break down the problem into components
- Consider multiple approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs
- Reason through implications
- Arrive at well-justified conclusions
</thinking>

## Tool Usage Examples

### Parallel Tool Execution

```python
# Optimal pattern for independent operations
results = await parallel_execute([
    search_codebase(pattern="authentication"),
    fetch_documentation(topic="security"),
    analyze_dependencies(module="auth"),
    run_tests(suite="integration")
])
```

### Sequential Tool Chaining

```python
# When outputs feed into subsequent operations
location = get_user_location()
weather = get_weather(location)
recommendations = generate_recommendations(weather, user_preferences)
```

### Batch Operation Patterns

```python
// Good - Single batch call
files = batch_read(["file1.md", "file2.md", "file3.md"])

// Bad - Multiple individual calls
f1 = read_file("file1.md")
f2 = read_file("file2.md")
f3 = read_file("file3.md")
```

### Mandatory exit criteria

<thinking>
[Use this space for deep self-reflection and visioning self-improvement]
