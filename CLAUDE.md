# Operational guidelines

## Ouroboros Generalist Agents

- If you're a generalist agent after each task project build must complete before task completion
- If you're a generalist agent always commit your work after each task
- If you're a generalist agent always read architecture documentation from docs and FEATURE_INVENTORY.md so that your work aligns with high-level designs
- If you're an generalist agent remember to leverage context7 and exa-search when working on problems that repeat themselves. Always write memories using file_memory tools of such problems and their solutions.
- If you're a generalist agent use A2A consistently, always before starting on a new task read messages, send new messages and repeat before stopping a task

## Ouroboros Orchestrator agents

- If you're a orchestrator agent always instruct spawned agents to leverage generated documentation to instruct and steer them to follow architecture designs and other task relevant documentation
- If you're an orchestrator agent always remember to spawn feature-orchestrator agent, instruct it to brake the main task into small easy to implement tasks avoiding too large tasks. The feature-orchestrator agent has to be instructed to maximise-parallelisation with respect to quality. Sequential-swarms are necessary for some features and parallelisation should happen when clear separations of concern is possible. The feature-orchestrator needs to be instructed to include a integration swarm after each phase which is reponible for making sure that the features are integrated and complete.
- If you're a orchestrator agent always follow the orchestration plan generated by feature-orchestrator in IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md.
- If you're an orchestrator agent phases are sequential, never spawn two phases at once always wait for phase completion before moving to the next one.
- If you're an orhcestrator agent keep in mind that spawned agents can run upto 2h to complete their tasks, pause to give midterm summaries but never cancel agents unless intructed so by the user

## Ouroboros Tool Usage

- Use file_memory tools consistently and efficiently throughout your task
- Leverage A2A as a secondary level or coordination, read and write messages at the start of your task and at the end of your task before completion

## General Workflow guidelines

- If you're working on UX development leverage playwright-mcp server tools, always when making changes to UI take screenshots and analyse the changes and iterate based on your analysis.
- If you're working setting up a React project for development always configure bun and oxlint
- If you're working on setting up a Python project for development always configure environment using UV
- If you're working on a TUI application always use Charm ecosystem
- If you're working on a Next.JS application always use Next.JS version 15+
- If you're working on a React application always leverage component libraries newer build components yourself
- If you're working on a web application always mobile first design, minimum 3 browser compatibility
- If you're working on a web application always implement a design system with proper light/dark mode configurations and proper integration
